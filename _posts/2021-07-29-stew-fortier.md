<br>

## Key Takeaways <br>

* We overestimate what we can do in a year, and underestimate what we can accomplish in a decade.
* peer relationship > heirarchical realationship
* Playing a non-zero sum game with others.
* It's important to embrace your own uniqueness. Comparison is the false game you are playing in. No one can beat you at being you.
* As a writer you need to think how can you be more like yourslef, how can you present the real you out on page, then that is a competitive advantage that other people are going to copy but they never going to succeed at that.
* How do stick with something consistently? Accountability is the nice way of saying this. Fear, guilt and shame are the honest tools to make yourself stick to something.
* Don't lose momentum.
