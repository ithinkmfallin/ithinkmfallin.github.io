* Your dream job wants you as badly as you want it.
* You have to be able to have contrast in ideas because that's how you advance and move forward.
* Progressive measure - You have to put yourself out there and stamp your moment like this is what I believe at this moment of time in order to measure the growth when you look back from few years from now.
* Each person's experience is an undeniable truth to them in that moment or their perception.  
* If you can't empathize with people then you can't even enter conversation with them to try to see thier point of view. If you don't listen to others, others won't listen to you.
