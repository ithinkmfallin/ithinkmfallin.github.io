<br>

## Key Takeaways <br>

* Seeing oneself progressing is addictive
* You will directly see the outcome of putting yourself in positive places
* You can not inch forward every single day, but looking back 6-9 months forward and auditing yourself thats when you start noticing progress
* Driving force can not be the appreciation or reognition from others. Do it if you feel proud of your work.
* You can only be example for someone, you can't force them and if they like them they will circle back
* When you are ready to quit, do it couple more, work on your mind (one more mentality)
* Doing things which align with highest version of yourself
