## Key Takeaways <br>

* Whatever area you are trying to improve, focus on the internal(the things you can control) instead of the external.
* Setting your goals and focusing on the process.
* Meditation is the way to filter and get back to inbox zero.
* Energy is the main thing we should be managing (prior to money and time management) - physical energy, mental energy, spiritual energy. 
* Confidence is a side-effect of doing hardship everyday.
* Mindset has to be about kickstarts, not just reading it and building the idea in mind.
* Don't chanse confidence, chase improvements and the proceses.
* Read books not just for the information but also to feel author's energy.
