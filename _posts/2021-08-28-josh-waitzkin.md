## Key Takeaways <br>

* Listen deeply, internally to the core of your being and build your game plan from there. Trust your gut and then build a lifestyle around listening to that.
* To be world-class (in any art) is to express the core of being through the art.
* When in doubt, leave it out. (Tim Ferris on Writing)
* Ending the workday with high quality focus on the certain area of complexity.
* Cognitive bias: Looking at a moment of any decisions with very clean presence outside of emotional inertia.
* Asking questions to self. Internal dialogue defines your day to day thinking and what you think you may become. (Tim Ferris)
* Recommended keystone habits/rituals: meditation, journaling, reflection on quality of day to day work.
* Ending the workday with high quality. 
* HIIT and meditation: cultivating the art of turning it ON and turning it OFF.
* Meditation is about returning to the breathe. Circling back from being caught up in mentalor emotional addiction and channeling them by returning to breathe.
* The hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear projects it onto his opponetn, while the coward runs. It's the same thing, fear, but it's what you do with it that matters. (Cus D'Amato)
* Observing youself as a third person in the anticipatory moments of your anger, fears
* Cultivate quality as a way of life. When you're not cultivating quality, you're cultivating sloppiness.
* Build a life around being true, do not build it around anything material.
