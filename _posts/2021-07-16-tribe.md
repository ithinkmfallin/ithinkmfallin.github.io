# Tribe: On Homecoming And Belonging

<br>

## Key Takeaways <br>

* Robert Frost famously wrote that home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.
* The word "tribe" is far harder to define, but a start might be the people you feel compelled to share the last of your food with. This sentiment is such a rare and precious thing in modern society and lack of it has affected us all.
* For many people - war feels better than peace and hardship can turn out to be the great belssing and disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or tropical vacations.
* Because of the basic freedoms, tribal members tended to be exceedingly loyal.
* As societies become more affluent they tend to require more, rather than less, time and commitment by the individual, and it's possible that many people feel that affluence and safety simply aren't good trade for freedom.
* The accumulation of personal property allowed people to make more and more individualistic choices about their lives, and those choices unavoidaly diminshed group efforts towards a common good.
* As society modernized, people found themselves able to live independently from any communal group.
* A peson living in modern society or suburb area, go through an entire day- or entire life - mostly encountering complete strangers. They can be surrounded by others and yet fel deeply, dangerously alone.
* Although happiness is notoriously subjective and difficult to measure, metal illness is not.
* As affluence and urbanization rise in a society, rates of depression and suicide tend to go up rather than down. Rather than buffering people from clicnical depression, increased wealth in society seems to foster it.
* A wealthy person who has never had to rely on help and resources from his community is leading a privileged life that falls way outside more than a million years of human experience. Financial indepepndece can lead to isolation, and isolation can put people at greatly increased risk of depression and suicide. This might be a fair trade for generally wealthier society- but a trade it is.
* Self-determination theory holds that human beings need three basic things in order to be content : they need to feel competent at what they do; they need to feel authentic in their lives; and they need to fel connected to others. These values are considered "intrinsic" to human happiness and far outweigh "extrinsic" values such as beauty, money and status.(Comeptence, Autonomy, Community)
* Modern society seems to emphasize extrinsic values over intrinsic ones, and as a result mental health issues refuse to decline with growing wealth.
* As modern society reduced the role of community, it simultaneously elevated the role of authority.
* Group co-operation triggers higher level of oxytocin. It increases dopamine and other pleasurable hormones in their blood.
