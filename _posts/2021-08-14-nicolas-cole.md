# Nicolas Cole - Flipping Negative Into Positive
<br>

## Key Takeaways <br>

* The goal should never be to write more words, the goal should be how can I write the most vvaluable, impactful, densely based packed created texts.
* There are multiple paths to success. The biggest problem is we don't proof check our guts.
* In order to get answers to the certain questions, we need data. In order to get data faster, we need environment that gives data faster. That environments are social. Those decisions are not based on your own gut feelings, it's then based on pieces and contents and validated data.
* It's far more important to understand what game you're playing rather than trying to spend much energy displaying the game going through emotions.
* Dominate one platform. Focus on one thing so you could translate to other area.
* Success is all about foundational stuff, basic stuff.
* Your greatest gift is your work ethic.
* None of the frameworks, models, methods matters unless you're consistent.
* Your time is valuable, Everyone's time is valuable. The harder you work at something, the more valuable the time becomes.
* Finding a mentor is not about asking someone to mentor you. It's about asking them one question - them giving you something to do. And then you going in and doing it and proving that you actually want to learn, coming back asking another thing to give. If you do that enough times over and over, they becomes your mentor.
* Treat your hours like a sport. 14 focused hours, 7 days a week.
* Be drawn to learning skills, not to the money.
* Really truly understand what direction you are moving yourself in. Lot of times it's actually hard to know. It's not black and white about successand failure. It's about knowing whether you're moving in a direction every single day you're connected to things that really matters to you. And if each of those compounds on themselves, what exponential growth can you lock in yourself over time.
