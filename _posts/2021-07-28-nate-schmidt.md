## Key Takeaways <br>

* When you have little bit of experience in something and you gain some success, it's indicator of your progress and the work you have put into.
* Everything that you do is there to expand you.
* At any point in your life, the seemingly minor decisions that you made at some point completely change the path of your life and completely make things way different than it would have been if you would have chosen a different path.
* We don't actually want the comfort. Comfort is great and its great to get some relaxation, be comfortable at some points in your life. But it's like what we're actually after is doing the work. Just keep doing it, keep grinding. Because in that grind is the wisdom.
* Life's all about the freedom of going out on a journey.
* What you are doing today will be aligned with the future you are going to build.
* When you have no comparisons, it's the place where you are at your pure self and are immersed in the present.
* It's really crazy what can happen when you just start to love, love yourself, love the moment, and just feel love for everythihng, everything situation that you go through, feel love. And that changes you so much, changes who you are.
* When someone speaks with love, they are making two seemingly seperate individualsone in that moment. 
* You need to focus on yourslef before your cup is filled and overflowed for others. It's not selfish.
* When you listen to yourslef, it draws other people into listening to you.
* Just starting putting out work without having any expectations(of being Joe Rogan).
* There's no thing like being good at meditation or being bad at meditation. Whole point of nothingness is to be aware of your thoughts as let them wander.
* Doing things for the first time and feeling weak vs getting stronger with each reps. (Apply this mentality to every aspect in life, be it you working out in gym, or practising mindfulness).
