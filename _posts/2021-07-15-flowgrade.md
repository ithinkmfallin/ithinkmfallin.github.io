<br>

## Key Takeaways <br>

* As for my job, I work with no structure or schedule at all. I throw myself completely into my current project and then I just do that.
* "Clocks are only there to interact with other people."
* “There are only 2 things I've put on my calendar in the past 10 years. Flights and interviews. "
* "The opponent of the flow is not knowing what is coming next."
* “When you write about things you already know, it is boring and feels like a chore. But when you sit down and discover new things for yourself as you write, that's exciting! "
* “Deal with bad things that could happen to you. And then realize that these things are not as bad as you thought. "
* How you can write the last chapter of your biography today, if you die mid day thats the end of the book, how cool to have a book which is always at a steo of constant completion and publish the day after you die.
