# Truth Telling

* The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there.
* You are the only person alive who has sole custody of your life. Your particular life. Your entire life.
* One day your heart will stop beating and none of your fears will matter. What will matter is how you lived.
* If you don’t enforce the boundaries, if you don’t set consequences, you’re not a leader. You’re simply an organizer.

# Notes of an Elder

* You must give up who you are to become who you can be.
* Life consists of two dates with a dash in between. Make the dash count.
* Don't waste your life suffering for something that was never worth suffering from.
* Recognize what you desire in life. Walk away from what moves you further from it.
* When you finally learn that a person's behaviour has more to do with their own internal struggle than you, you learn grace. 
* Life is too short to take things too seriously and personally.
* Self-trust is not only about trusting ourselves to make the right decision; it involves trusting that even if we make the wrong decision we will be okay.
* When you focus on the past, it's all ego.
* Winning requires focus, concentration and mental toughness to repeat small but important tasks day after day without complaining.

# Questioning Yourself

* Have you been able to let go of your old self so you can make ample room for who you are evolving into?
* What have you learned from past relationships that you feel committed applying in your present relationships?
* What do you want your life to feel like six months from now?
* What do you need to outgrow to bloom into your best self?
* Over the last year, what has become more important to you? What has become less important?
* What new positive habits are you currently working on building? What is your strategy for maintaining and sustaining this new habit in the long-term? 
* What brings you deep joy?
* Where do you need to change and what’s stopping you?
* What have you forgotten to do lately, and how can you become more aligned with what brings you joy?
* What am I missing by choosing to worry or be afraid?
* How am I taking shape in this season of my life?

# Bonus

* When a reporter asked him to pick his greatest achievement over his illustrious career, Branch Rickey paused for a moment, then answered, "It hasn't happened yet."
* Gregg Popovich is 72 years old and has won five NBA championships, but is still running. Not away from excuses but towards facing it. How often do we inflict discipline upon our teams for committing some sort of error or infraction but fail to hold ourselves to the same standard? You mess up, you run.
* Naomi Osaka, the fastest rising star in all of tennis, unexpectedly withdrew from the French Open earlier this week — taking to Instagram to poignantly detail her little-known battles with anxiety and depression. We must not dehumanize the lived experiences of others just because they might be different from our own.
