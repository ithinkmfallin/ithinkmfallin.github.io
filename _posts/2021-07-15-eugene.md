# Eugene Wei: Compress to Impress

<br>

## Key Takeaways <br>
* Follow your interests
* Keep renewing your “novice permit” – every few years go into a field where you are a complete novice
* “If you want to grow as a person, you have to push yourself out of equilibrium” 
* Be a first principles thinker
* Keep asking, “Why?” to get to the fundamental truth, and then work your way up to understand the problem from a new perspective 
* "To start over and be a student again forces you into a different frame of mind”
* It also puts you in a state of being humble and getting comfortable with failure – failure is how you learn
* It’s important to discuss/analyze stories of failure – those stories likely have more important lessons 
* A lot of successful individuals say they visualize the move they want to make and their desired outcome – this is especially true for athletes
